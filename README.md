# Coffee Bot
One of my first programming projects. A simple coffee ordering bot written in Java.

## Description
A simple coffee bot that asks for a custom coffee order (number of shots in the coffee), calculates cost, and correctly identifies change denominations. Errors are handled appropriately.
