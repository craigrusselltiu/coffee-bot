# Coffee Bot
One of my first programming projects. A simple coffee bot that asks for a custom coffee order (number of shots in the coffee), calculates cost, and correctly identifies change denominations. Errors are handled appropriately.

## Running
Run the code by running CoffeeBot with 2 command line arguments - how much stock the shop initially has of cups and coffee shots:

```
java CoffeeBot cupsInStock shotsInStock
```
